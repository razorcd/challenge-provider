# Challenge platform

This application is a platform for providing challenges for candidates. 
Candidates can not see the challenge until they start it.
Once started, the challenge has a time countdown until the challenge should be completed. Uploading solutions after countdown time expired is also possible but the timestamp will be stored.

The application also provides an administration interface to manage challenges for Admins.   
An admin creates a challenge, it receives an ID of the challenge and the link to send to the candidate. (like: `http://localhost:8080/challengeSources/102f11c4-9ef5-4b7a-a152-4278b6b95931
`)


## Technology used:

Java with SpringBoot, Spring Security, JSP, Jackson, JUnit, Mokito and JavaScript. 

The persistence is file storage. Why? Just for fun. (Ideally would be RDB.)

Tests are also included. 

### Start development

1. Install Maven 3.5 and Java 8.
2. `mvn clean install`
3. `java out/app.jar`

### Start docker locally
